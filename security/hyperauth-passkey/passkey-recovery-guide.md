# Passkey Recovery Guide

### What is the Recovery Code?

The Recovery Code is a unique, one-time code generated to provide a master reset capability for your passkeys. Its primary purpose is to help you regain access to your wallet if you lose all the devices where your passkeys are stored.

If you lose access to all your passkeys, you can use this Recovery Code to **delete all passkeys** associated with your wallet. This action allows you to set up a new passkey and regain control over your wallet and the assets within it, such as your LP positions.

**IMPORTANT:** The Recovery Code is a powerful tool. Treat it with the same level of security as your wallet's private key. Store it in a secure, offline location (like a password manager or a physical safe) where only you can access it.

### How It Works: For New Users

If you are a new user or are creating a passkey for the first time, the process is straightforward:

1. When you create your **very first passkey** for your Hyperion wallet, the system will automatically generate and display your unique Recovery Code.
2. You **must** save this code immediately. You will not be shown this code again.
3. If you ever lose all your passkey-enabled devices, you can navigate to the passkey management page and select the option to recover access using your Recovery Code. This will remove all existing passkeys and allow you to start fresh.

### Attention: For Existing Passkey Users

This Recovery Code feature was introduced recently. If you created your passkey(s) **before this update**, your account **does not have a Recovery Code** associated with it.This means that if you currently lose access to all your devices with existing passkeys, you will be unable to use this new recovery feature. To ensure you are protected, we strongly recommend you take one of the following actions:

#### Recommended Actions for Existing Users

You have two options to secure your account against device loss.

**Option 1: Create a Backup Passkey (Recommended)**

This is the simplest and a highly effective security practice. By creating a second passkey and storing it on a different, trusted device (e.g., a tablet, a secondary phone, or a hardware security key), you create redundancy.

* **How it helps:** If you lose your primary device, you can simply use your backup passkey from the second device to access your wallet and delete the passkey from the lost device.

**Option 2: Re-create Your Passkey to Generate a Recovery Code**

If you wish to utilize the new Recovery Code feature, you will need to reset your current passkey setup.

* **How to do it:**
  1. Go to your wallet's security settings.
  2. **Delete** your existing passkey(s).
  3. **Create a new passkey.** Since this will now be the "first" passkey created after the feature update, the system will generate a new Recovery Code for you.
  4. **Crucially, save this new Recovery Code in a secure location.**

**Warning:** Before choosing this option, ensure you have full access to your wallet and can perform the action of deleting your current passkey. If you have only one passkey and you are unsure about the process, we recommend starting with Option 1 to create a backup first.By taking one of these steps, you can ensure that a lost device doesn't mean lost access to your valuable assets. We encourage all our existing users to review their passkey setup and take action today.
