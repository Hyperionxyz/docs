To access the Website, you must use a non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service of that third party, not this Agreement. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with us, and we do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to our Website, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.

**Modification of this Agreement**

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement from time to time. If we make any material modifications, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of the Agreement and by maintaining a current version of the Agreement at [Terms of Service](https://docs.hyperion.xyz/legal-and-compliance/terms-of-service). All modifications will be effective when they are posted, and your continued accessing or use of the Website will serve as confirmation of your acceptance of those modifications. If you do not agree with any modifications to this Agreement, you must immediately stop accessing and using the Website.



**Description of Services provided through the Website**

By using the Website, you understand that you are not buying or selling virtual assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to liquidity providers for the Protocol. As a general matter, the Hyperion team is not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity providers are independent third parties.

**Not Registered with the SEC or Any Other Agency**

We are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a national securities exchange or in any other capacity. You understand and acknowledge that we do not offer to sell or solicit offers to buy any securities on the Website or broker trading orders on your behalf. We also do not facilitate the execution or settlement of your trades, which occur entirely on the public distributed blockchains like Ethereum. As a result, we do not (and cannot) guarantee market best pricing or best execution through the Website.



**Non-Solicitation; No Investment Advice**

You agree and understand that: (a) all trades you submit through the Website are considered unsolicited, which means that they are solely initiated by you; (b) you have not received any investment advice from us in connection with any trades; and (c) we do not conduct a suitability review of any trades you submit.

We may provide information about tokens on the Website sourced from third-party data partners through features such as rarity scores, token explorer or token lists. We may also provide warning labels for certain tokens. The provision of informational materials does not make trades in those tokens solicited; we are not attempting to induce you to make any purchase as a result of information provided. All such information provided by the Website is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice or a recommendation that a particular token is a safe or sound investment. You should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information contained on the Website. By providing token information for your convenience, we do not make any investment recommendations to you or opine on the merits of any transaction or opportunity. You alone are responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances, and risk tolerance.



**Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duties**

The Website is a purely non-custodial application, meaning we do not ever have custody, possession, or control of your virtual assets at any time. It further means you are solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets you hold and you should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. We accept no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and make no representations or warranties regarding how the Website will operate with any specific wallet. Likewise, you are solely responsible for any associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with or as a result of your wallet being compromised.

This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in this Agreement.



**Compliance and Tax Obligations**

The Website may not be available or appropriate for use in your jurisdiction. By accessing or using the Website, you agree that you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and regulations that may apply to you.

Specifically, your use of the Website or the Protocol may result in various tax consequences, such as income or capital gains tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales tax in certain jurisdictions. It is your responsibility to determine whether taxes apply to any transactions you initiate or receive and, if so, to report and/or remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.



**Gas Fees**

Blockchain transactions require the payment of transaction fees to the appropriate network (“Gas Fees”). These fees are not levied directly by us, but rather determined by your use of the Protocol and the underlying blockchain communities at large. You understand that we have no control over Gas Fees, (including without limitation, their applicability, payment, amounts, transmission, intended operation and effectiveness) whether related to your use of the Protocol or otherwise. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the terms of another offer by Hyperion, you will be solely responsible to pay the Gas Fees for any transaction that you initiate. You agree that in no event will Hyperion be responsible to you or any other party of the payment, repayment, refund, disbursement, indemnity, or for any other aspect of your use or transmission of Gas Fees.



**Assumption of Risk**

BY ACCESSING AND USING THE WEBSITE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE FINANCIALLY AND TECHNICALLY SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USING CRYPTOGRAPHIC AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SYSTEMS, AND THAT YOU HAVE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF THE USAGE AND INTRICACIES OF VIRTUAL ASSETS SUCH AS ETHER (ETH), SO-CALLED STABLECOINS, AND OTHER DIGITAL TOKENS SUCH AS THOSE FOLLOWING THE ETHEREUM TOKEN STANDARD (ERC-20), OR STANDARDS OF ANY OTHER DIGITAL TOKENS WHICH ARE TRANSACTED ON HYPERION.

In particular, you understand and agree that your access and use of our Website are subject to certain inherent risks, which without limitations, include:

**High Volatility.**

The markets for these virtual assets are nascent and highly volatile due to risk factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and runs. You further acknowledge and accept the risk of selecting to trade in Expert Modes, which can expose you to potentially significant price slippage and higher costs. You are responsible for any losses or missed opportunities resulting from slippage, regardless of your circumstances. You are therefore reminded to review the slippage tolerance level before proceeding with a trade. If you act as a liquidity provider to the Protocol through the Website, you understand that your virtual assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to the Protocol through the Website due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool. Further, You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are variable and may increase dramatically at any time.

**Regulatory Uncertainties.**

New or changes in the regulatory regime in different jurisdictions may materially and adversely affect your use of the Website and/or the Protocol, the transfer and the value of the virtual assets available on Hyperion.

**Malfunctions and errors. The transactions are supported by one or more smart contracts on the blockchain. Smart contracts may be subject to malfunctions, errors, including but not limited to programming errors, hacking, theft, or other technological difficulties which may prevent access to or use of your virtual assets.**

**Automatic Transactions and Accidental Transfers. You understand that smart contract transactions automatically execute and settle, and that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible when confirmed. Inputting an incorrect wallet address, wrong chain, leakage of private keys may result in an irrecoverable loss of your virtual assets.**

**Fraudulent Transactions.**

Transactions on the Protocol may be susceptible to mining attacks, hacking, security weakness, fraud, counterfeiting, cyberattacks and other technological difficulties that are beyond our control. The occurrence of such events may result in an irreversible loss of the virtual assets.

Finally, you understand that we do not create, own, or operate cross-chain bridges and we do not make any representation or warranty about the safety or soundness of any cross-chain bridge, including its use for Hyperion governance.

The list of risks set out above is not intended to be comprehensive or exhaustive. In summary, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Website. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Website to interact with the Protocol. You acknowledge that you should conduct your own due diligence and obtain sufficient independent information to make an informed decision before using our Website or the Protocol.



**Third-Party Resources and Promotions**

If you access any such resources or participate in any such promotions, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that this Agreement does not apply to your dealings or relationships with any third parties. You expressly relieve us of any and all liability arising from your use of any such resources or participation in any such promotions. Unless expressed otherwise, we and such third party resources are independent legal entities, and this Agreement shall not constate any form of agency, partnership or cooperative relationship between the parties. We and such third party resources shall be separately responsible for their respective claims, debts and disputes arising from the performance of their respective contracts and agreement.

No developer or entity involved in creating the Protocol will be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users of, the Protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value. We do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by third parties concerning the Website.



**Limitation of Liability**

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WE OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, OR SUBSIDIARIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING (BUT NOT LIMITED TO) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE PROPERTY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY ACCESS OR USE OF THE WEBSITE, NOR WILL WE BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS, OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING, OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN IT.

THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.



**No Insurance**

You agree that your crypto wallet(s) do not constitute as a checking or savings accounts. We do not provide any kinds of insurance to you against any type of loss, including without limitation, losses due to decrease in value of your virtual assets, assets lost due to a cybersecurity failure, or from your or other individuals’ errors or malfeasance. Most jurisdictions do not regard virtual assets as a legal tender, and most virtual assets are not backed by any government. Neither your virtual assets balance nor any of your transactions via the Protocol are covered by the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Scheme or other similar protections.



**Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**

The law of this arbitration clause shall be Hong Kong law. The seat of arbitration shall be Hong Kong. The number of arbitrators shall be three.
