# Risk Factors

Purchasing services or products Hyperion and/or RION or xRION entail significant risk. We strongly recommend that you carefully review all information in this document, including the following risk factors, or any other document related to the sale of RION or xRION before deciding to purchase RION or xRION and/or perform actions related to RION or xRION. The actual occurrence of any of the following events could have a material adverse effect on the development, business, prospects and results of operations of Hyperion, which may adversely affect your ability to receive rewards from your acquisitions. Many of these factors are contingencies that may or may not occur, and we cannot estimate the likelihood of such contingencies occurring. Although the risks discussed below are not exhaustive and represent only those that we consider to be significant, they may not be the only risks and uncertainties that may be faced by Hyperion. Additional risks not currently known, expected or believed to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on the companyâ€™s development, business, prospects and results of operations Hyperion, and you may lose a significant portion or all of the price paid to purchase the Hyperion products and/or RION or xRION. Thus, the purchase of Hyperion services or products and/or performing actions related to RION or xRION must be carried out exclusively by individuals who may bear such risks. Before participating, please consider the potential risks carefully and, if necessary, consult with legal, accounting and tax professionals to assess the risk involved.



**Risks of the Token Economy**: The token economy is relatively new, and tokens may potentially be subject to regulations, including restrictions on ownership or use. There is no guarantee that the purchased RION or xRION will increase in value, provide a profit, or achieve sufficient distribution and liquidity to be exchanged for other assets.



**Risks associated with cryptocurrency volatility**: In general, the rate at which any cryptocurrency can be exchanged for other currencies is extremely volatile.



**Risk of uninsured losses**: Unlike traditional financial accounts, RION are not insured by government-backed institutions. Users may purchase private insurance for additional protection. Therefore, if they are lost or the value of the tokens is lost, we do not have a government sponsored insurance company or private insurance company to offer you compensation.



**Risks related to taxation**: Tax characteristics of RION are unclear. You should seek your own tax advice in connection with your purchase of RION and use of the products on Hyperion.



**Risks associated with uncertain regulations and enforcement actions**: The regulatory status of RION and xRION is unclear or unresolved in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulators will be able to apply existing regulations to such technology and its applications. Likewise, it is difficult to predict how or whether legislators or regulators will be able to make changes to laws and regulations affecting such technology and its applications. Regulatory actions may negatively impact Hyperion in various ways, including, for example, by determining that the purchase, sale, delivery or use of RION or xRION constitutes an illegal activity or that registration or licensing is required for some or all parties involved in the purchase, sale, delivery or use of RION or xRION.
