### Overview

RION is the native, cryptographically-secure, and fungible token of the Hyperion platform. As a transferable token, RION serves utility functions as specified on the Hyperion platform.&#x20;

RION serves as a versatile utility token, facilitating decentralized exchange and settlement among participants within the Hyperion platform. The primary objective of RION is to provide a secure and efficient means of transaction between platform participants, eliminating the need for intermediaries such as centralized entities or institutions. RION is **not**, and is **not intended to be**, a medium of exchange accepted by the general public (or any section of the public) as payment for goods, services, or the discharge of debt, nor is it intended to be used for any purposes other than those exclusively provided by the issuer.

RION is awarded as an economic incentive to encourage user contributions and participation on the platform, establishing a mutually beneficial structure where participants are fairly rewarded based on their efforts. The distribution of additional RION is strictly dependent on actual usage, activity, and contributions to the platformâ€”such as frequency and volume of transactions. Users who do not actively participate or contribute will not receive RION incentives.
