# xRION Token

**Basic Information**

* **Name**: Hyperion Escrowed Token
* **Ticker**: xRION
* **Chain**: Aptos
* **Collection Address**: TBD



### Overview

xRION is the escrowed, non-transferable governance token of the Hyperion platform. xRION can be obtained by converting RION. xRION enables holders to participate in governance within the Hyperion DAO framework (when the DAO is established), as well as to access certain platform features, such as launchpool participation. Further details on conversion mechanisms are provided below.



### How xRION Works

Users may stake RION on the platform to receive xRION. Users may lock RION for various periods (up to 52 weeks total) to receive xRION, which represents voting power and other rights within the Hyperion platform. The amount of xRION received depends on both the amount of RION locked and the duration of the lock-up, calculated as:

xRION amount = Number of RION locked × Number of weeks locked (up to 52)



#### Examples:

* 1 RION locked for 1 week = 1 xRION
* 1 RION locked for 52 weeks = 52 xRION
* 10 RION locked for 10 weeks = 100 xRION
* 5 RION locked for 40 weeks = 200 xRION

The xRION balance decreases linearly each week as the remaining lock-up period shortens.



#### Extending the Lock-up Period:

Users may extend their lock-up period at any time to increase or maintain their xRION balance; however, the new total remaining lock-up period after extension cannot exceed the maximum of 52 weeks.

#### For example:

* If a user locks 1 RION for 52 weeks, they initially receive 52 xRION.
* After 10 weeks (remaining 42 weeks, 42 xRION), if the user extends the lock-up back to 52 weeks, their xRION balance restores to 52 xRION.
* If a user has 5 RION locked for 20 weeks (initially 100 xRION), and after 5 weeks (remaining 15 weeks, 75 xRION) extends the lock-up to 40 weeks, the xRION balance becomes 200 xRION (5 RION × 40 weeks).
* In all cases, the new total remaining lock-up period after extension cannot exceed 52 weeks.

When the lock-up expires, the original RION is returned to the user, and the corresponding xRION balance is reduced to zero.



### Utilities

* **Staking**:\
  By staking RION, users automatically participate and hold xRION and become eligible for xRION staking rewards. These rewards are supported by the treasury of the Hyperion platform and made available on a discretionary basis – further details on the reward program and updates thereto will be published from time to time via official channels. They are a way to give back to the community, sharing the benefits of the growth of the platform.\

* **Governance**:\
  Following the formal establishment of the Hyperion DAO, xRION will enable holders to participate in platform proposals and voting within the DAO. Voting rights will be based on the amount of xRION held, in accordance with the governance framework defined by the DAO (when the DAO is established).\

* **Launchpad Participation**:\
  xRION balances may be used as a whitelist requirement or for calculating allocation quotas for launchpool participation on the Hyperion launchpad.

Further utilities for xRION may be introduced as the Hyperion platform evolves.
