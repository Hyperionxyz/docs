# Drips

### Introduction

The Drips System rewards users for actively participating in the ecosystem through liquidity provision, trading, and community growth via referrals.

Drips are calculated and accumulated daily based on user actions and can be used to unlock exclusive benefits and incentives within the platform.

### Point Categories & Earning Mechanisms

#### 1. Hyperion’s Drips

Users earn Hyperion Drip through providing liquidity and engaging in trading activity. Drips are calculated daily and rounded down (floor).

#### A. Liquidity Provision (LP Points)

| Action                    | Point Calculation | Rule                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Provide $100 in liquidity | 5 Points per Day  | Minimum $100 liquidity to qualify |

* **Example Calculation**:
  * Provide $500 in liquidity
  * Points per day: (500 ÷ 100) × 5 = 25 Points

#### B. Trade Points (Based on Fee Tiers)

| Fee Tier | Point Calculation                    | Rule |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ---- |
| 0.01%    | 1 Point per $100 in trading volume   |      |
| 0.05%    | 5 Points per $100 in trading volume  |      |
| 0.1%     | 10 Points per $100 in trading volume |      |

* **Example Calculation (Fee Tier 0.05%)**:
  * $1,000 trading volume
  * Points: (1,000 ÷ 100) × 5 = 50 Points

#### 2. Invitation Points

Users are rewarded for inviting others to the platform. Each user is assigned a unique 6-character alphanumeric invitation code. Points are earned from both direct and second-level invitees.

#### A. Liquidity Referral Rewards

| Relationship Level   | Point Reward               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Direct Invitee       | 20% of LP Points generated |
| Second-Level Invitee | 10% of LP Points generated |

#### B. Trading Referral Rewards

| Relationship Level   | Point Reward                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Direct Invitee       | 20% of Trade Points generated |
| Second-Level Invitee | 10% of Trade Points generated |

* **Example Calculation (Liquidity)**:
  * Direct invitee earns 100 LP Points
  * You receive 20% of 100 = 20 Points
* **Example Calculation (Trade)**:
  * Second-level invitee earns 200 Trade Points
  * You receive 10% of 200 = 20 Points

### Multipliers & Bonus Mechanisms
