(i) You agree that to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Laws, in no event shall any Company Party be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Site, the Platform, Company Content or the Services. Under no circumstances will any Company Party be responsible for any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access or use of the Site, the Platform, the Services or the Company Content and other information contained therein. To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Laws, we assume no liability or responsibility for any (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of our Site, the Platform, Company Content or the Services; (c) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein; (d) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Site, the Platform or the Services; (e) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through our Site, the Platform, Company Content or the Services by any third party; (f) any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Site, the Platform or the Services; and/or (g) User Content or the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party. You agree that if, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, a Company Party is found to be liable for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs, such Company Party's liability shall in no event exceed the amount you paid to us hereunder during the 6-month period prior to the date on which such claim arose, if any.

(ii) This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damage. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

15. Limitations as Allowed by Law

Some states, provinces and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties, or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This Agreement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by Applicable Laws.

16. Force Majeure

We will have no responsibility or liability for any failure or delay in performance of the Site, the Platform or any of the Services, or any loss or damage that you may incur, due to any circumstance or event beyond our control, including any (a) flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, (b) fire, (c) war, (d) insurrection, (e) riot, (f) labour dispute, (g) accident, (h) epidemic or pandemic, (i) action of government, (j) new laws or regulations or change in existing laws or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement of any of the foregoing, (k) communications, (l) power failure, (m) equipment or software unavailability, disruption or malfunction, (n) hacking or other attack on the Site, the Platform or the Services, (o) the unavailability, disruption or malfunction of any network or blockchains or (p) the unavailability, disruption or malfunction of the Internet.

17. Non-Waiver

Our failure or delay in insisting upon or enforcing strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or rights. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision, nor shall any waiver of any provision of this Agreement constitute a continuing waiver unless expressly made in writing by us.

18. Severability

In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these terms and conditions shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

19. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This Agreement is entered into in the British Virgin Islands and shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the British Virgin Islands. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the British Virgin Islands or any other judicial district or jurisdiction as we may determine in any and all actions, disputes or controversies relating hereto. You further agree as follows: (a) any claim brought to enforce these terms and conditions must be commenced within 6 months of the cause of action accruing; (b) no recovery may be sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and legal fees; and (c) any claim must be brought individually and not consolidated as part of a group or class action complaint.

20. Amendments

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify the terms of this Agreement from time to time. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by providing notice through the Site, the Services or updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Agreement. Unless we state otherwise in our notice, all such modifications are effective immediately, and your continued use of the Site and the Services after we provide that notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended terms of this Agreement, then your only recourse is to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to us and must stop using the Site and the Services.

21. Language

This Agreement, including all other documents incorporated by reference herein, are binding and constitute the entire agreement between us and you with respect to your use of the Site and the Services. The parties agree that the English language will be the language of the Agreement and all documents in connection thereto, and each party waives any right (whether statutory or otherwise) to use and rely upon any other language, or translations. Il est de la volonté expresse des parties que tous les documents qui s'y rattachent soient rédigés en langue anglaise.
