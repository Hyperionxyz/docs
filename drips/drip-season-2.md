# Drip Season 2

## Introduction

DRIPs Season 2 is Hyperion’s upgraded reward system that incentivizes real participation in the ecosystem through trading, liquidity provision, and deeper engagement with the RION token.

DRIPs are calculated and accumulated **daily**, and will later be used to unlock exclusive incentives and airdrop allocations. This season runs from **August 7 - TBD**

***

## Point Categories & Earning Mechanisms

#### Hyperion DRIPs

Users can earn DRIPs in three ways: trading, providing liquidity, and engaging with RION utility. All DRIPs are calculated daily and rounded down.

***

### A. Trade DRIPs (Based on Fees Paid)

Users earn DRIPs based on the trading fees they generate. Each $0.01 in fees contributes to 1 DRIP. Selected pools have different multipliers based on their fee tiers.

#### **Fee Tiers & Multipliers**

<table><thead><tr><th width="194.49609375">Fee Tier</th><th>DRIP Rate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0.01%</td><td>1 DRIP per $100 in trading volume</td></tr><tr><td>0.05%</td><td>5 DRIPs per $100 in trading volume</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Eligible Trading Pools:**

* USDT/USDC (0.01%)
* APT/USDC (0.05%)
* APT/USDT (0.05%)
* xBTC/USDC (0.05%)
* APT/xBTC (0.05%)
* WBTC/USDC (0.05%)
* WBTC/xBTC (0.01%)
* APT/WBTC (0.05%)
* APT/kAPT (0.01%)
* USD1/USDC (0.01%)
* sUSDe/USDC (0.01%)

**Example Calculation (APT/USDT Pool, 0.05% Fee Tier):**

$1,000 trading volume → Fee = $0.50 →

DRIPs = $0.50 ÷ $0.01 = 50 DRIPs

***

### B. Liquidity DRIPs (LP Points)

Liquidity providers earn DRIPs based on the size and type of pool they supply liquidity to. Only selected pools are eligible.

#### Pool-Based Reward Rates

<table><thead><tr><th width="286.3984375">Pool</th><th>DRIP Rate</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>USDT/USDC (0.01%)</td><td>1 DRIP per $200 liquidity per day</td></tr><tr><td>Other Liquidity Pools</td><td>1 DRIP per $100 liquidity per day</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Eligible Liquidity Pools:**

* USDT/USDC (0.01%)
* APT/USDC (0.05%)
* APT/USDT (0.05%)
* xBTC/USDC (0.05%)
* APT/xBTC (0.05%)
* WBTC/USDC (0.05%)
* WBTC/xBTC (0.01%)
* APT/WBTC (0.05%)
* APT/kAPT (0.01%)
* USD1/USDC (0.01%)
* sUSDe/USDC (0.01%)

**Example Calculation (APT/USDT Pool):**

Provide $500 liquidity → (500 ÷ 100) × 1 = **5 DRIPs per day**
