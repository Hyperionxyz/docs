# Asset Withdrawl Rate Limits

At Hyperion, safeguarding your assets is our top priority. To further strengthen security and mitigate risks, we implemented a new Rate Limit feature for withdrawals from June 20, 2025.



Key Details:

* Withdrawal Threshold: Each asset has a predefined maximum withdrawal limit per 24-hour period.
* Cooling-Off Period: If the threshold is exceeded, new withdrawal requests will enter a 24-hour waiting period before processing.
* User Impact: Once the limit is reached, your withdrawal will show as "Pending" status and a clear "Releasing Time" will be displayed.
* Expedited Processing: For urgent withdrawals during cooling-off periods, clients may contact their designated point of contact to request priority processing (subject to security verification).
